ACT III

SCENE I. Florence. The Duke's palace.

   Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with
   a troop of soldiers.

   Duke

   So that from point to point now have you heard
   The fundamental reasons of this war,
   Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
   And more thirsts after.

   First Lord

   Holy seems the quarrel
   Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
   On the opposer.

   Duke

   Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
   Would in so just a business shut his bosom
   Against our borrowing prayers.

   Second Lord

   Good my lord,
   The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
   But like a common and an outward man,
   That the great figure of a council frames
   By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
   Say what I think of it, since I have found
   Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
   As often as I guess'd.

   Duke

   Be it his pleasure.

   First Lord

   But I am sure the younger of our nature,
   That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
   Come here for physic.

   Duke

   Welcome shall they be;
   And all the honours that can fly from us
   Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
   When better fall, for your avails they fell:
   To-morrow to the field.

   Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The Count's palace.

   Enter Countess and Clown

   Countess

   It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he comes not
   along with her.

   Clown

   By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.

   Countess

   By what observance, I pray you?

   Clown

   Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask
   questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this
   trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

   Countess

   Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

   Opening a letter

   Clown

   I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our old ling and our
   Isbels o' the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o'
   the court: the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to love,
   as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

   Countess

   What have we here?

   Clown

   E'en that you have there.

   Exit

   Countess

   [Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath recovered the king,
   and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the
   `not' eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it before the report
   come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long
   distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram.

   This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
   To fly the favours of so good a king;
   To pluck his indignation on thy head
   By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
   For the contempt of empire.

   Re-enter Clown

   Clown

   O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young
   lady!

   Countess

   What is the matter?

   Clown

   Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not
   be killed so soon as I thought he would.

   Countess

   Why should he be killed?

   Clown

   So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does: the danger is in
   standing to't; that's the loss of men, though it be the getting of
   children. Here they come will tell you more: for my part, I only hear
   your son was run away.

   Exit

   Enter Helena, and two Gentlemen

   First Gentleman

   Save you, good madam.

   Helena

   Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

   Second Gentleman

   Do not say so.

   Countess

   Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
   I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
   That the first face of neither, on the start,
   Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

   Second Gentleman

   Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
   We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
   And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
   Thither we bend again.

   Helena

   Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

   [Reads] When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall
   come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to,
   then call me husband: but in such a `then' I write a `never.'

   This is a dreadful sentence.

   Countess

   Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

   First Gentleman

   Ay, madam;
   And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.

   Countess

   I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
   If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
   Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
   But I do wash his name out of my blood,
   And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

   Second Gentleman

   Ay, madam.

   Countess

     And to be a soldier?

   Second Gentleman

   Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
   The duke will lay upon him all the honour
   That good convenience claims.

   Countess

   Return you thither?

   First Gentleman

   Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

   Helena

   [Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
   'Tis bitter.

   Countess

     Find you that there?

   Helena

   Ay, madam.

   First Gentleman

   'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his heart was not
   consenting to.

   Countess

   Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
   There's nothing here that is too good for him
   But only she; and she deserves a lord
   That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
   And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

   First Gentleman

   A servant only, and a gentleman
   Which I have sometime known.

   Countess

   Parolles, was it not?

   First Gentleman

   Ay, my good lady, he.

   Countess

   A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
   My son corrupts a well-derived nature
   With his inducement.

   First Gentleman

   Indeed, good lady,
   The fellow has a deal of that too much,
   Which holds him much to have.

   Countess

   You're welcome, gentlemen.
   I will entreat you, when you see my son,
   To tell him that his sword can never win
   The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
   Written to bear along.

   Second Gentleman

   We serve you, madam,
   In that and all your worthiest affairs.

   Countess

   Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
   Will you draw near!

   Exeunt Countess and Gentlemen

   Helena

   `Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
   Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
   Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
   Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
   That chase thee from thy country and expose
   Those tender limbs of thine to the event
   Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
   That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
   Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
   Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
   That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
   Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
   That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
   Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
   Whoever charges on his forward breast,
   I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
   And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
   His death was so effected: better 'twere
   I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
   With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
   That all the miseries which nature owes
   Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
   Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
   As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
   My being here it is that holds thee hence:
   Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
   The air of paradise did fan the house
   And angels officed all: I will be gone,
   That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
   To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
   For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

   Exit

SCENE III. Florence. Before the Duke's palace.

   Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram, Parolles, Soldiers,
   Drum, and Trumpets

   Duke

   The general of our horse thou art; and we,
   Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
   Upon thy promising fortune.

   Bertram

   Sir, it is
   A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
   We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
   To the extreme edge of hazard.

   Duke

   Then go thou forth;
   And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
   As thy auspicious mistress!

   Bertram

   This very day,
   Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
   Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
   A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

   Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rousillon. The Count's palace.

   Enter Countess and Steward

   Countess

   Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
   Might you not know she would do as she has done,
   By sending me a letter? Read it again.

   Steward

   [Reads] I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
   Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
   That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
   With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
   Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
   My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
   Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
   His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
   His taken labours bid him me forgive;
   I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
   From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
   Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
   He is too good and fair for death and me:
   Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

   Countess

   Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
   Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
   As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
   I could have well diverted her intents,
   Which thus she hath prevented.

   Steward

   Pardon me, madam:
   If I had given you this at over-night,
   She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
   Pursuit would be but vain.

   Countess

   What angel shall
   Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
   Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
   And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
   Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
   To this unworthy husband of his wife;
   Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
   That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
   Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
   Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
   When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
   He will return; and hope I may that she,
   Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
   Led hither by pure love: which of them both
   Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
   To make distinction: provide this messenger:
   My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
   Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

   Exeunt

SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.

   Enter an old Widow of Florence, Diana, Violenta, and Mariana, with
   other Citizens

   Widow

   Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the
   sight.

   Diana

   They say the French count has done most honourable service.

   Widow

   It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander; and that
   with his own hand he slew the duke's brother.

   Tucket

   We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may
   know by their trumpets.

   Mariana

   Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it.
   Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl: the honour of a maid is her
   name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.

   Widow

   I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his
   companion.

   Mariana

   I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a filthy officer he is in
   those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their
   promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust,
   are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by
   them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck
   of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they
   are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to
   advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you
   are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is
   so lost.

   Diana

   You shall not need to fear me.

   Widow

   I hope so.

   Enter Helena, disguised like a Pilgrim

   Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at my house; thither
   they send one another: I'll question her. God save you, pilgrim!
   whither are you bound?

   Helena

   To Saint Jaques le Grand.
   Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

   Widow

   At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

   Helena

   Is this the way?

   Widow

   Ay, marry, is't.

   A march afar

   Hark you! they come this way.
   If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
   But till the troops come by,
   I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
   The rather, for I think I know your hostess
   As ample as myself.

   Helena

   Is it yourself?

   Widow

   If you shall please so, pilgrim.

   Helena

   I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

   Widow

   You came, I think, from France?

   Helena

   I did so.

   Widow

   Here you shall see a countryman of yours
   That has done worthy service.

   Helena

   His name, I pray you.

   Diana

   The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

   Helena

   But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
   His face I know not.

   Diana

   Whatsome'er he is,
   He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
   As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
   Against his liking: think you it is so?

   Helena

   Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

   Diana

   There is a gentleman that serves the count
   Reports but coarsely of her.

   Helena

   What's his name?

   Diana

   Monsieur Parolles.

   Helena

     O, I believe with him,
   In argument of praise, or to the worth
   Of the great count himself, she is too mean
   To have her name repeated: all her deserving
   Is a reserved honesty, and that
   I have not heard examined.

   Diana

   Alas, poor lady!
   'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
   Of a detesting lord.

   Widow

   I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
   Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
   A shrewd turn, if she pleased.

   Helena

   How do you mean?
   May be the amorous count solicits her
   In the unlawful purpose.

   Widow

   He does indeed;
   And brokes with all that can in such a suit
   Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
   But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
   In honestest defence.

   Mariana

   The gods forbid else!

   Widow

   So, now they come:

   Drum and Colours

   Enter Bertram, Parolles, and the whole army

   That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
   That, Escalus.

   Helena

     Which is the Frenchman?

   Diana

   He;
   That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
   I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
   He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

   Helena

   I like him well.

   Diana

   'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
   That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
   I would Poison that vile rascal.

   Helena

   Which is he?

   Diana

   That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

   Helena

   Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

   Parolles

   Lose our drum! well.

   Mariana

   He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.

   Widow

   Marry, hang you!

   Mariana

   And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

   Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, and army

   Widow

   The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
   Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
   There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
   Already at my house.

   Helena

   I humbly thank you:
   Please it this matron and this gentle maid
   To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
   Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
   I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
   Worthy the note.

   Both

     We'll take your offer kindly.

   Exeunt

SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.

   Enter Bertram and the two French Lords

   Second Lord

   Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.

   First Lord

   If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your
   respect.

   Second Lord

   On my life, my lord, a bubble.

   Bertram

   Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

   Second Lord

   Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice,
   but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an
   infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no
   one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.

   First Lord

   It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which
   he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main
   danger fail you.

   Bertram

   I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

   First Lord

   None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so
   confidently undertake to do.

   Second Lord

   I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such I will
   have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and
   hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried
   into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own
   tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not,
   for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear,
   offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power
   against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath,
   never trust my judgment in any thing.

   First Lord

   O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a
   stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success
   in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if
   you give him not John Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be
   removed. Here he comes.

   Enter Parolles

   Second Lord

   [Aside to Bertram] O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour
   of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.

   Bertram

   How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

   First Lord

   A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

   Parolles

   `But a drum'! is't `but a drum'? A drum so lost! There was excellent
   command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend
   our own soldiers!

   First Lord

   That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a
   disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had
   been there to command.

   Bertram

   Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in
   the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.

   Parolles

   It might have been recovered.

   Bertram

   It might; but it is not now.

   Parolles

   It is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom
   attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or
   another, or 'hic jacet.'

   Bertram

   Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery
   in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native
   quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will grace the
   attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall
   both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,
   even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.

   Parolles

   By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

   Bertram

   But you must not now slumber in it.

   Parolles

   I'll about it this evening: and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,
   encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal
   preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.

   Bertram

   May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

   Parolles

   I know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt I vow.

   Bertram

   I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership,
   will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

   Parolles

   I love not many words.

   Exit

   Second Lord

   No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,
   that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is
   not to be done; damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to
   do't?

   First Lord

   You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will
   steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of
   discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after.

   Bertram

   Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously
   he does address himself unto?

   Second Lord

   None in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two
   or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see
   his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

   First Lord

   We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first
   smoked by the old lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell
   me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very
   night.

   Second Lord

   I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

   Bertram

   Your brother he shall go along with me.

   Second Lord

   As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

   Exit

   Bertram

   Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
   The lass I spoke of.

   First Lord

   But you say she's honest.

   Bertram

   That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
   And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
   By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
   Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
   And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
   Will you go see her?

   First Lord

   With all my heart, my lord.

   Exeunt

SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.

   Enter Helena and Widow

   Helena

   If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
   I know not how I shall assure you further,
   But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

   Widow

   Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
   Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
   And would not put my reputation now
   In any staining act.

   Helena

   Nor would I wish you.
   First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
   And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
   Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
   By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
   Err in bestowing it.

   Widow

   I should believe you:
   For you have show'd me that which well approves
   You're great in fortune.

   Helena

   Take this purse of gold,
   And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
   Which I will over-pay and pay again
   When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
   Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
   Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
   As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
   Now his important blood will nought deny
   That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
   That downward hath succeeded in his house
   From son to son, some four or five descents
   Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
   In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
   To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
   Howe'er repented after.

   Widow

   Now I see
   The bottom of your purpose.

   Helena

   You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
   But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
   Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
   In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
   Herself most chastely absent: after this,
   To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
   To what is passed already.

   Widow

   I have yielded:
   Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
   That time and place with this deceit so lawful
   May prove coherent. Every night he comes
   With musics of all sorts and songs composed
   To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
   To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
   As if his life lay on't.

   Helena

   Why then to-night
   Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
   Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
   And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
   Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
   But let's about it.

   Exeunt
