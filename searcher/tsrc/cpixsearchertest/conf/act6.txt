All's Well That Ends Well

EPILOGUE

   King

   The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
   All is well ended, if this suit be won,
   That you express content; which we will pay,
   With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
   Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
   Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

   Exeunt
