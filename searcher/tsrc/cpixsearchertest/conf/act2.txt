ACT II

SCENE I. Paris. The King's palace.

   Flourish of cornets. Enter the King, attended with divers young Lords
   taking leave for the Florentine war; Bertram, and Parolles

   King

   Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
   Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
   Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
   The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
   And is enough for both.

   First Lord

   'Tis our hope, sir,
   After well enter'd soldiers, to return
   And find your grace in health.

   King

   No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
   Will not confess he owes the malady
   That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
   Whether I live or die, be you the sons
   Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
   Those bated that inherit but the fall
   Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
   Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
   The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
   That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.

   Second Lord

   Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!

   King

   Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
   They say, our French lack language to deny,
   If they demand: beware of being captives,
   Before you serve.

   Both

     Our hearts receive your warnings.

   King

   Farewell. Come hither to me.

   Exit, attended

   First Lord

   O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

   Parolles

   'Tis not his fault, the spark.

   Second Lord

   O, 'tis brave wars!

   Parolles

   Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

   Bertram

   I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
   `Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

   Parolles

   An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

   Bertram

   I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
   Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
   Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
   But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

   First Lord

   There's honour in the theft.

   Parolles

   Commit it, count.

   Second Lord

   I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

   Bertram

   I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

   First Lord

   Farewell, captain.

   Second Lord

   Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

   Parolles

   Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a
   word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one
   Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his
   sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrenched it: say to him, I
   live; and observe his reports for me.

   First Lord

   We shall, noble captain.

   Exeunt Lords

   Parolles

   Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

   Bertram

   Stay: the king.

   Re-enter King. Bertram and Parolles retire

   Parolles

   [To Bertram] Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
   restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu: be more
   expressive to them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the time,
   there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and move under the influence of
   the most received star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are
   to be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.

   Bertram

   And I will do so.

   Parolles

   Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

   Exeunt Bertram and Parolles

   Enter Lafeu

   Lafeu

   [Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

   King

   I'll fee thee to stand up.

   Lafeu

   Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
   I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
   And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

   King

   I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
   And ask'd thee mercy for't.

   Lafeu

   Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
   Will you be cured of your infirmity?

   King

   No.

   Lafeu

   O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
   Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
   My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
   That's able to breathe life into a stone,
   Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
   With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
   Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
   To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
   And write to her a love-line.

   King

   What `her' is this?

   Lafeu

   Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
   If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
   If seriously I may convey my thoughts
   In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
   With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
   Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
   Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
   For that is her demand, and know her business?
   That done, laugh well at me.

   King

   Now, good Lafeu,
   Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
   May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
   By wondering how thou took'st it.

   Lafeu

   Nay, I'll fit you,
   And not be all day neither.

   Exit

   King

   Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

   Re-enter Lafeu, with Helena

   Lafeu

   Nay, come your ways.

   King

   This haste hath wings indeed.

   Lafeu

   Nay, come your ways:
   This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
   A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
   His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
   That dare leave two together; fare you well.

   Exit

   King

   Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

   Helena

   Ay, my good lord.
   Gerard de Narbon was my father;
   In what he did profess, well found.

   King

   I knew him.

   Helena

   The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
   Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
   Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
   Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
   And of his old experience the oily darling,
   He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
   Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
   And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
   With that malignant cause wherein the honour
   Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
   I come to tender it and my appliance
   With all bound humbleness.

   King

   We thank you, maiden;
   But may not be so credulous of cure,
   When our most learned doctors leave us and
   The congregated college have concluded
   That labouring art can never ransom nature
   From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
   So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
   To prostitute our past-cure malady
   To empirics, or to dissever so
   Our great self and our credit, to esteem
   A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

   Helena

   My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
   I will no more enforce mine office on you.
   Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
   A modest one, to bear me back a again.

   King

   I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
   Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
   As one near death to those that wish him live:
   But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
   I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

   Helena

   What I can do can do no hurt to try,
   Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
   He that of greatest works is finisher
   Oft does them by the weakest minister:
   So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
   When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
   From simple sources, and great seas have dried
   When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
   Oft expectation fails and most oft there
   Where most it promises, and oft it hits
   Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

   King

   I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
   Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
   Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

   Helena

   Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
   It is not so with Him that all things knows
   As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
   But most it is presumption in us when
   The help of heaven we count the act of men.
   Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
   Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
   I am not an impostor that proclaim
   Myself against the level of mine aim;
   But know I think and think I know most sure
   My art is not past power nor you past cure.

   King

   Are thou so confident? within what space
   Hopest thou my cure?

   Helena

   The great'st grace lending grace
   Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
   Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
   Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
   Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
   Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
   Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
   What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
   Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

   King

   Upon thy certainty and confidence
   What darest thou venture?

   Helena

   Tax of impudence,
   A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
   Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
   Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
   With vilest torture let my life be ended.

   King

   Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
   His powerful sound within an organ weak:
   And what impossibility would slay
   In common sense, sense saves another way.
   Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
   Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
   Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
   That happiness and prime can happy call:
   Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
   Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
   Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
   That ministers thine own death if I die.

   Helena

   If I break time, or flinch in property
   Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
   And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
   But, if I help, what do you promise me?

   King

   Make thy demand.

   Helena

     But will you make it even?

   King

   Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

   Helena

   Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
   What husband in thy power I will command:
   Exempted be from me the arrogance
   To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
   My low and humble name to propagate
   With any branch or image of thy state;
   But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
   Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

   King

   Here is my hand; the premises observed,
   Thy will by my performance shall be served:
   So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
   Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
   More should I question thee, and more I must,
   Though more to know could not be more to trust,
   From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
   Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
   Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
   As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

   Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The Count's palace.

   Enter Countess and Clown

   Countess

   Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.

   Clown

   I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I know my business is
   but to the court.

   Countess

   To the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that
   with such contempt? But to the court!

   Clown

   Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it
   off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand
   and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such
   a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have
   an answer will serve all men.

   Countess

   Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.

   Clown

   It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock,
   the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.

   Countess

   Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

   Clown

   As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French
   crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a
   pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
   hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling
   knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to
   his skin.

   Countess

   Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?

   Clown

   From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any
   question.

   Countess

   It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.

   Clown

   But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth
   of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me if I am a
   courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.

   Countess

   To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to
   be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

   Clown

   O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of
   them.

   Countess

   Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

   Clown

   O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

   Countess

   I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

   Clown

   O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

   Countess

   You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

   Clown

   O Lord, sir! spare not me.

   Countess

   Do you cry, `O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and `spare not me?' Indeed
   your `O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer
   very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

   Clown

   I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my `O Lord, sir!' I see things may
   serve long, but not serve ever.

   Countess

   I play the noble housewife with the time
   To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

   Clown

   O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

   Countess

   An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
   And urge her to a present answer back:
   Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
   This is not much.

   Clown

   Not much commendation to them.

   Countess

   Not much employment for you: you understand me?

   Clown

   Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

   Countess

   Haste you again.

   Exeunt severally

SCENE III. Paris. The King's palace.

   Enter Bertram, Lafeu, and Parolles

   Lafeu

   They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to
   make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is
   it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming
   knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.

   Parolles

   Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our
   latter times.

   Bertram

   And so 'tis.

   Lafeu

   To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

   Parolles

   So I say.

   Lafeu

   Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

   Parolles

   So I say.

   Lafeu

   Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

   Parolles

   Right; so I say.

   Lafeu

   That gave him out incurable,--

   Parolles

   Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

   Lafeu

   Not to be helped,--

   Parolles

   Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

   Lafeu

   Uncertain life, and sure death.

   Parolles

   Just, you say well; so would I have said.

   Lafeu

   I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

   Parolles

   It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you shall read it
   in--what do you call there?

   Lafeu

   A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

   Parolles

   That's it; I would have said the very same.

   Lafeu

   Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me, I speak in respect--

   Parolles

   Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the brief and the tedious
   of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge
   it to be the--

   Lafeu

   Very hand of heaven.

   Parolles

   Ay, so I say.

   Lafeu

   In a most weak--

   pausing

   and debile minister, great power, great transcendence: which should,
   indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the
   king, as to be--

   pausing

   generally thankful.

   Parolles

   I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.

   Enter King, Helena, and Attendants. Lafeu and Parolles retire

   Lafeu

   Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the better, whilst I
   have a tooth in my head: why, he's able to lead her a coranto.

   Parolles

   Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

   Lafeu

   'Fore God, I think so.

   King

   Go, call before me all the lords in court.
   Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
   And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
   Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
   The confirmation of my promised gift,
   Which but attends thy naming.

   Enter three or four Lords

   Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
   Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
   O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
   I have to use: thy frank election make;
   Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

   Helena

   To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
   Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

   Lafeu

   I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
   My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
   And writ as little beard.

   King

   Peruse them well:
   Not one of those but had a noble father.

   Helena

   Gentlemen,
   Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.

   All

   We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

   Helena

   I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
   That I protest I simply am a maid.
   Please it your majesty, I have done already:
   The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
   `We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
   Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
   We'll ne'er come there again.'

   King

   Make choice; and, see,
   Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

   Helena

   Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
   And to imperial Love, that god most high,
   Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

   First Lord

   And grant it.

   Helena

     Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

   Lafeu

   I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.

   Helena

   The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
   Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
   Love make your fortunes twenty times above
   Her that so wishes and her humble love!

   Second Lord

   No better, if you please.

   Helena

   My wish receive,
   Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

   Lafeu

   Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
   I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
   Turk, to make eunuchs of.

   Helena

   Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
   I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
   Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
   Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

   Lafeu

   These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her: sure, they are
   bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.

   Helena

   You are too young, too happy, and too good,
   To make yourself a son out of my blood.

   Fourth Lord

   Fair one, I think not so.

   Lafeu

   There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine: but if thou
   be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.

   Helena

   [To Bertram] I dare not say I take you; but I give
   Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
   Into your guiding power. This is the man.

   King

   Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

   Bertram

   My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
   In such a business give me leave to use
   The help of mine own eyes.

   King

   Know'st thou not, Bertram,
   What she has done for me?

   Bertram

   Yes, my good lord;
   But never hope to know why I should marry her.

   King

   Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

   Bertram

   But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
   Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
   She had her breeding at my father's charge.
   A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
   Rather corrupt me ever!

   King

   'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
   I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
   Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
   Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
   In differences so mighty. If she be
   All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
   A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
   Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
   From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
   The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
   Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
   It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
   Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
   The property by what it is should go,
   Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
   In these to nature she's immediate heir,
   And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
   Which challenges itself as honour's born
   And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
   When rather from our acts we them derive
   Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
   Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
   A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
   Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
   Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
   If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
   I can create the rest: virtue and she
   Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

   Bertram

   I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

   King

   Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

   Helena

   That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
   Let the rest go.

   King

   My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
   I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
   Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
   That dost in vile misprision shackle up
   My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
   We, poising us in her defective scale,
   Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
   It is in us to plant thine honour where
   We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
   Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
   Believe not thy disdain, but presently
   Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
   Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
   Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
   Into the staggers and the careless lapse
   Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
   Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
   Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

   Bertram

   Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
   My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
   What great creation and what dole of honour
   Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
   Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
   The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
   Is as 'twere born so.

   King

   Take her by the hand,
   And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
   A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
   A balance more replete.

   Bertram

   I take her hand.

   King

   Good fortune and the favour of the king
   Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
   Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
   And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
   Shall more attend upon the coming space,
   Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
   Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

   Exeunt all but Lafeu and Parolles

   Lafeu

   [Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

   Parolles

   Your pleasure, sir?

   Lafeu

   Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.

   Parolles

   Recantation! My lord! my master!

   Lafeu

   Ay; is it not a language I speak?

   Parolles

   A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.
   My master!

   Lafeu

   Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

   Parolles

   To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

   Lafeu

   To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.

   Parolles

   You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

   Lafeu

   I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring
   thee.

   Parolles

   What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

   Lafeu

   I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou
   didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs
   and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing
   thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I have now found thee; when I
   lose thee again, I care not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking
   up; and that thou't scarce worth.

   Parolles

   Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

   Lafeu

   Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial;
   which if--Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of
   lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
   through thee. Give me thy hand.

   Parolles

   My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

   Lafeu

   Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

   Parolles

   I have not, my lord, deserved it.

   Lafeu

   Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.

   Parolles

   Well, I shall be wiser.

   Lafeu

   Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the
   contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt
   find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my
   acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the
   default, he is a man I know.

   Parolles

   My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

   Lafeu

   I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal: for
   doing I am past: as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me
   leave.

   Exit

   Parolles

   Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old,
   filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of
   authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any
   convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I'll have no more
   pity of his age than I would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet
   him again.

   Re-enter Lafeu

   Lafeu

   Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for you: you have
   a new mistress.

   Parolles

   I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of
   your wrongs: he is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master.

   Lafeu

   Who? God?

   Parolles

   Ay, sir.

   Lafeu

   The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o'
   this fashion? dost make hose of sleeves? do other servants so? Thou
   wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if
   I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a
   general offence, and every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
   created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

   Parolles

   This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

   Lafeu

   Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a
   pomegranate; you are a vagabond and no true traveller: you are more
   saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your
   birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word,
   else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.

   Exit

   Parolles

   Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good; let it be concealed
   awhile.

   Re-enter Bertram

   Bertram

   Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

   Parolles

   What's the matter, sweet-heart?

   Bertram

   Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
   I will not bed her.

   Parolles

   What, what, sweet-heart?

   Bertram

   O my Parolles, they have married me!
   I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

   Parolles

   France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
   The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

   Bertram

   There's letters from my mother: what the import is, I know not yet.

   Parolles

   Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
   He wears his honour in a box unseen,
   That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
   Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
   Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
   Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
   France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
   Therefore, to the war!

   Bertram

   It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
   Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
   And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
   That which I durst not speak; his present gift
   Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
   Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
   To the dark house and the detested wife.

   Parolles

   Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

   Bertram

   Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
   I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
   I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

   Parolles

   Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
   A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
   Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
   The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

   Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The King's palace.

   Enter Helena and Clown

   Helena

   My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

   Clown

   She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's very merry; but yet
   she is not well: but thanks be given, she's very well and wants nothing
   i', the world; but yet she is not well.

   Helena

   If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's not very well?

   Clown

   Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

   Helena

   What two things?

   Clown

   One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! the other
   that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!

   Enter Parolles

   Parolles

   Bless you, my fortunate lady!

   Helena

   I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.

   Parolles

   You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them
   still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

   Clown

   So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you
   say.

   Parolles

   Why, I say nothing.

   Clown

   Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his
   master's undoing: to say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and
   to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a
   very little of nothing.

   Parolles

   Away! thou'rt a knave.

   Clown

   You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a knave; that's,
   before me thou'rt a knave: this had been truth, sir.

   Parolles

   Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

   Clown

   Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The
   search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to
   the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

   Parolles

   A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
   Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
   A very serious business calls on him.
   The great prerogative and rite of love,
   Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
   But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
   Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
   Which they distil now in the curbed time,
   To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
   And pleasure drown the brim.

   Helena

   What's his will else?

   Parolles

   That you will take your instant leave o' the king
   And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
   Strengthen'd with what apology you think
   May make it probable need.

   Helena

   What more commands he?

   Parolles

   That, having this obtain'd, you presently
   Attend his further pleasure.

   Helena

   In every thing I wait upon his will.

   Parolles

   I shall report it so.

   Helena

   I pray you.

   Exit Parolles

   Come, sirrah.

   Exeunt

SCENE V. Paris. The King's palace.

   Enter Lafeu and Bertram

   Lafeu

   But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

   Bertram

   Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

   Lafeu

   You have it from his own deliverance.

   Bertram

   And by other warranted testimony.

   Lafeu

   Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

   Bertram

   I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge and accordingly
   valiant.

   Lafeu

   I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his
   valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in
   my heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make us friends; I will
   pursue the amity.

   Enter Parolles

   Parolles

   [To Bertram] These things shall be done, sir.

   Lafeu

   Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

   Parolles

   Sir?

   Lafeu

   O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a very good
   tailor.

   Bertram

   [Aside to Parolles] Is she gone to the king?

   Parolles

   She is.

   Bertram

   Will she away to-night?

   Parolles

   As you'll have her.

   Bertram

   I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
   Given order for our horses; and to-night,
   When I should take possession of the bride,
   End ere I do begin.

   Lafeu

   A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one
   that lies three thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand
   nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you,
   captain.

   Bertram

   Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

   Parolles

   I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.

   Lafeu

   You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all, like him
   that leaped into the custard; and out of it you'll run again, rather
   than suffer question for your residence.

   Bertram

   It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

   Lafeu

   And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's prayers. Fare you well,
   my lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light
   nut; the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of
   heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures.
   Farewell, monsieur: I have spoken better of you than you have or will
   to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

   Exit

   Parolles

   An idle lord. I swear.

   Bertram

   I think so.

   Parolles

   Why, do you not know him?

   Bertram

   Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
   Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

   Enter Helena

   Helena

   I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
   Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
   For present parting; only he desires
   Some private speech with you.

   Bertram

   I shall obey his will.
   You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
   Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
   The ministration and required office
   On my particular. Prepared I was not
   For such a business; therefore am I found
   So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
   That presently you take our way for home;
   And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
   For my respects are better than they seem
   And my appointments have in them a need
   Greater than shows itself at the first view
   To you that know them not. This to my mother:

   Giving a letter

   'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so I leave you to your wisdom.

   Helena

   Sir, I can nothing say,
   But that I am your most obedient servant.

   Bertram

   Come, come, no more of that.

   Helena

   And ever shall
   With true observance seek to eke out that
   Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
   To equal my great fortune.

   Bertram

   Let that go:
   My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

   Helena

   Pray, sir, your pardon.

   Bertram

   Well, what would you say?

   Helena

   I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
   Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
   But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
   What law does vouch mine own.

   Bertram

   What would you have?

   Helena

   Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
   I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
   Faith yes;
   Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

   Bertram

   I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

   Helena

   I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

   Bertram

   Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

   Exit Helena

   Go thou toward home; where I will never come
   Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
   Away, and for our flight.

   Parolles

   Bravely, coragio!

   Exeunt
