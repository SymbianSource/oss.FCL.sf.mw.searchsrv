General
=======

Log Player framework contains two components: Log Player recorder and
Log Player for executing recorded log files. Log Player recorder is 
part of Search Server. By default Search Server does not record log files and
Search Server must be instrumented separately to generate log files. 
Log Player is separate program used to execute stored log files.

Recording log file
==================

Log file recording is disabled by default. To enable recording:
1) Open file cfg/searchserverdefs.h
2) This file should contain following line
   //#define RECORD_FOR_LOG_PLAYER
   Uncomment this to enable log recording
3) Recompile Search Server and reinstall sis-file to phone.
4) Create folder C:\logs\CPix\LogPlayer
5) All search/indexing activities will be logged to
   c:\logs\CPix\LogPlayer\LogPlayer.txt
   This will work on urel and udeb builds.
Note: Remember to delete old log file before recording new logs. If there
exists old file then new data is added to start of file.

Executing stored log file
=========================

LogPlayer.exe is used to execute stored log file. Steps to execute log:
1) Compile LogPlayer. This is also included from main bld.inf file.
   (LogPlayer is test component so build with "abld test build")
2) Install LogPlayer to phone
   (Generate sis-file from s60\test\LogPlayer\sis\logplayer.pkg)
3) Move stored log file to place where Log Player can find it. There are
   2 possibilities

   Option 1. Create file c:\data\LPConf.txt. 
   
   Content of this file should be absolute paths to log files.
   Each line should be in own line.
   
   Example content:

   c:\data\MyLogPlayer1.txt
   c:\data\MyLogPlayer2.txt
   
   Log Player will execute each specified log file in given order


   Option 2. Move log data to file C:\data\LPDefault.txt.
   
   Log Player will execute log data from that file. Note: LPConf.txt must
   be deleted or Log Player will never read log data from LPDefault.txt

4) Start LogPlayer.exe
   - Run from Applications menu or
   - From eshell typing "LogPlayer"

   Log Player starts interpreting given log file. Log Player will 
   print latest command to console.
